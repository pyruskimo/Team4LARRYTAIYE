The trick with this assignment it not to have a lot of text to commit you want small commits like one definition at t a time.  You have to think 2 things:
You just want to have to edit a little bit of text to resolve a merge conflict
You don’t want merge conflicts and you avoid merge conflicts by not having the same text on a line
The basic steps are

Create a repo
Everyone clones to their clocks
Create a branch for the task / definition
On your local do a commit on the Branch
Push to the branch to GitHub
Create a pull request for the branch to be merged
Merge the branch to master
Everyone pulls the master branch
Repeat for the next tasks
You will need to add all team members to the repo using the settings menu so everyone can push

Notes you can also fork a repo to your own and then clone and this makes it so you don’t have to add everyone to the main repo.  But when you create a pull request you got to click this link that says “compare across forks” so you can pick out branches from other forks
